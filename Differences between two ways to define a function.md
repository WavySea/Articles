There are two ways to define a function, which are ``function declaration`` and ``function expression``.     
- function declaration:    
 1. function declaration will be read first before the code begins to execute. （function declaration hoisting）
 2. If there are two function declaration for a same function, browswers return the second declaration.    
     
     
- function expression:    
 1. Any time a function is being used as a value, it is a function expression. This value can only be visited inside the function or in the global scope.
